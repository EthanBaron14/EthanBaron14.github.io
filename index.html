                        I am actively involved extracurricularly in both disciplines that I am studying. 
                        Starting in Spring 2020, I accepted a position where I have since served as a member of course instructional staff in the Computer Science department.
                        I have worked on a number of classes, including Database Systems & Team Projects, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, and Alogorithms & Data Structures.
                        Through this opportunity, I have gained experience teaching others complicated information in a way that makes it not only easy for them to learn, but also to apply in their studies.

                        In Spring 2022, I was appointed by the GW Investment Institute to serve as the Teaching Assistant for the Quantitative Trading course, run through the Finance department.
                        Alongside the Vice Dean of Undergraduate Programs, I revised course learning outcomes, created a new syllabus, and facilitated the creation of new assignments.
                        I also provided support to the students on their semesterlong project and helped with grading assignments.

                        During the Summer of 2021, I worked with Amazon Web Services as a Software Development Engineer Intern. I worked within the Elastic Container Services org on AWS Proton.
                        With the guidance of my mentor, I created template validation features, reducing the number of customer actions required to validate templates by 50%.
                        Through this experience, I mastered Kotlin and nine AWS technologies. 
                        I really appreciated the opportunity to gain exposure to new languages and new technologies, all with the support of an amazing team.

                    <p>From February to August 2020, I worked on OpenNetVM, an open-sourced, high-performance NFV platform based on DPDK and Docker containers. During that summer, I worked with a research group composed of five undergraduate students and over 20 graduate students.</p>
                    <p>During the academic year, I attended bi-weekly meetings with the other undergraduate students and the professor whose lab we worked for. Several times per week over the summer, I attended regular research meetings with professor to provide direction for research focus.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I contributed to the project directly on GitHub by making changes to the codebase, attending and participating in code reviews, and reviewing pull requests created by other contributors for releases.</p>
                    <p>During the summer, I had the privilege of working with several of my peers on a machine learning component, where we worked to analyze a dataset consisting of four million data points to predict resource usage by serverless platforms.
                        I worked with one of my peers to setup a JupyterHub development environment on our lab's server cluster, which is accessible by anyone in our lab.
                    </p>
                    <p>The OpenNetVM project, while a research project at heart, was treated and managed like a released platform. We regularly reviewed code for releases and enforced strict style guide for release code. Additionally, we regularly collaborated over Slack, Discord, Zoom and Webex to work on complicated problems together.</p>

                    <p>The research group also maintains a cluster of Linux servers on campus. System Administration using Linux was something that I had not specifically had experience with, despite my background in Information Technology.
                        However, I was already experienced with Linux operating systems and command-line management; this experience enabled me to better contribute to managing the cluster.</p>

                    <p>One of the largest projects I contributed to for one of my courses, CSCI 2541 - Database Systems and Team Projects provided an interesting challenge that I had not been exposed to before: project integration.</p>
                    <p>In this class, I worked in a group of three to build one of the modules for a graduate computer science program web platform. My group was tasked with building the application system, complete with a LAMP stack back-end and Bootstrap front-end.</p>
                    <p>After building and styling the application processing system, my group demonstrated the functionality of the platform to instructional staff. We were then broken up into a different set of groups of three students.</p>
                    <p>In my second group, composed of students who built different modules of the platform, we were tasked with integrating the modules to form one cohesive system that looked consistent and accessed appropriate data from the MySQL database.</p>
                    <p>This was a unique challenge because I had not had exposure to project integration. We had to rework the database tables to integrate each of our modules such that they could all function together. We then added analytics queries, statistics, and a set of extra features.</p>
                    <p>The class culminated in a final demo in front of the instructional staff where our integration and functionality was tested in real-time. Our platform was exposed to rigorous testing and evaluation, including edge-case and bad input testing.</p>

                        I joined my university's chapter of Delta Sigma Pi in Fall 2019. Since, I have been elected to executive committee positions including Vice President - Pledge Education,
                        Chancellor, Vice President - Risk Management and Vice President - Technology. These roles exposed me to a variety of leadership opportunities and situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Vice President - Pledge Education, I supervised the education and integration of a new pledge class into our Brotherhood.
                        In this role, I facilitated professional development and enabled the pledge class to form lifelong bonds with each other and the Brothers in our organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Chancellor, I facilitated our Chapter Meetings. This gave me valuable experience speaking in front of and presenting ideas to a large group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Vice President - Technology, I maintained the existing technology implementations that my chapter utilized and also introduced new projects and initiatives that would either improve or introduce new technology implementations to our chapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These projects included learning Tableau Public to create visualizations for my chapter's membership and representation. Examples of what I built using Tableau can be seen <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/ethan.baron#!/vizhome/XiRho/AlumniLocation-Dashboard" class="text-primary" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The visualizations I made using Tableau can be seen throughout our chapter's <a href="https://www.gwudsp.com" class="text-primary" target="_blank">website</a>, which was built on Squarespace. I also updated our website with new information about our chapter and our events.
