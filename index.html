                        I am actively involved extracurricularly in both disciplines that I am studying. 
                        Starting in Fall 2019, I began work with the Division of Information Technology at my university.
                        There, I have gained experience demonstrating proper use of university-provided technology systems.
                        The same semester, I rushed a professional business fraternity and have had the privilege of serving on its executive committee ever since.

                        Since then, in Spring 2020, I accepted a position where I have since served as a member of course instructional staff in the Computer Science department.
                        During my first semester in this role, I worked as a Learning Assistant facilitating laboratory sections of the Algorithms and Data Structures course.
                        This summer, I am working with the Software Engineering professor to prepare educational materials for the Fall 2020 semester.
                        Through this opportunity, I have gained experience teaching others complicated information in a way that makes it not only easy for them to learn, but also to apply in their studies.

                        In March of this past spring, I also began work with Dr. Timothy Wood in his networking and distributed systems lab in the Computer Science department.
                        When I joined his lab, I immediately began contributing to the codebase of OpenNetVM, a NFV platform based on DPDK and Docker containers. More on that below.

                    <p>Starting Spring 2020, I contributed to OpenNetVM, an open-sourced, high-performance NFV platform based on DPDK and Docker containers. During that summer, I worked with a research group composed of five undergraduate students and over 20 graduate students.</p>
                    <p>During the academic year, I attended bi-weekly meetings with the other undergraduate students and the professor whose lab we worked for. Several times per week over the summer, I attended regular research meetings with professor to provide direction for research focus.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, I contributed to the project directly on GitHub by making changes to the codebase, attending and participating in code reviews, and reviewing pull requests created by other contributors for releases.</p>
                    <p>During the summer, I had the privilege of working with several of my peers on a machine learning component, where we worked to analyze a dataset consisting of four million data points to predict resource usage by serverless platforms.
                        I worked with one of my peers to setup a JupyterHub development environment on our lab's server cluster, which is accessible by anyone in our lab.
                    </p>
                    <p>The OpenNetVM project, while a research project at heart, was treated and managed like a released platform. We regularly reviewed code for releases and enforced strict style guide for release code. Additionally, we regularly collaborated over Slack, Discord, Zoom and Webex to work on complicated problems together.</p>

                    <p>The research group also maintains a cluster of Linux servers on campus. System Administration using Linux was something that I had not specifically had experience with, despite my background in Information Technology.
                        However, I was already experienced with Linux operating systems and command-line management; this experience enabled me to better contribute to managing the cluster.</p>

                    <p>One of the largest projects I contributed to for one of my courses, CSCI 2541 - Database Systems and Team Project provided an interesting challenge that I had not been exposed to before: project integration.</p>
                    <p>In this class, I worked in a group of three to build one of the modules for a graduate computer science program web platform. My group was tasked with building the application system, complete with a LAMP stack back-end and Bootstrap front-end.</p>
                    <p>After building and styling the application processing system, my group demonstrated the functionality of the platform to instructional staff. We were then broken up into a different set of groups of three students.</p>
                    <p>In my second group, composed of students who built different modules of the platform, we were tasked with integrating the modules to form one cohesive system that looked consistent and accessed appropriate data from the MySQL database.</p>
                    <p>This was a unique challenge because I had not had exposure to project integration. We had to rework the database tables to integrate each of our modules such that they could all function together. We then added analytics queries, statistics, and a set of extra features.</p>
                    <p>The class culminated in a final demo in front of the instructional staff where our integration and functionality was tested in real-time. Our platform was exposed to rigorous testing and evaluation, including edge-case and bad input testing.</p>

                    <p>I rushed my university's chapter of Delta Sigma Pi in Fall 2019. Since, I have been elected to executive committee positions including VP Risk Management and VP Technology. These roles exposed me to a variety of leadership opportunities and situations.</p>
                    <p>As VP Technology, I maintained the existing technology implementations that my chapter utilized and also introduced new projects and initiatives that would either improve or introduce new technology implementations to our chapter.</p>
                    <p>These projects included learning Tableau Public to create visualizations for my chapter's membership and representation. Examples of what I built using Tableau can be seen <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/ethan.baron#!/vizhome/XiRho/AlumniLocation-Dashboard" class="text-primary" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>The visualizations I made using Tableau can be seen throughout our chapter's <a href="https://www.gwudsp.com" class="text-primary" target="_blank">website</a>, which was built on Squarespace. I also updated our website with new information about our chapter and our events.</p>
                    <p>This presented another opportunity for me to practice using Domain Management systems and Email Forwarding. These were two technologies that I have extensive experience with prior to my election to the position, but it presented a unique opportunity to learn more about them.</p>
